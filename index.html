    My Favorite hobby is Drawing, how did I notice it and found it? Well, it all started back in early elementary school, when I was preparing for a drawing examination(I was in 2nd Grade at the time), and daily drawing classes taught me simple things like drawing a tree with a pencil or something and it countinued for ages untill my last drawing examination happened when i was 6 years old and in 3rd Grade, I remember my drawing from 2 years ago, and it was terrible, still, I passed. Then, after that, I was at homeschool, and then drawing wasn't a subject, but then I still drew in my tests and homework. Fastfowarding to today, I still draw snowy pine trees, toy guns et cetera. Now, that my dad bought himself a new smartphone, he handed his used one to me. Fortunately, it had a stylus and a Notes app. so now I draw more than ever, my last drawing was a simulation of Manali, a place I visited in March, it had normal pine tress and also skinny pine trees you can see in Solang.I hope my expert drawing skills are yet to come.
